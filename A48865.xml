            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BE not ſurprized, or wonder, that ſome <hi>Controverſie</hi> is riſen among our <hi>United Brethren:</hi> For when ſuch a Subject as this is ſtarted, it is no fault to be <hi>ſtriving,</hi> who ſhall be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it.</p>
            <p>It hath been obſerved of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> that when they were freed from <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Perſecution, they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pieces among <hi>Themſelves:</hi> And when were there greater ſtirs about the Religion now ours, than at the beginning of the <hi>Reformation?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:107137:3"/>
            <p>It hath pleaſed God, at this time, to open a Door to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> for <hi>Liberty:</hi> And it hath pleaſed the ſame good God alſo, we hope, to give us that Grace, to make a better uſe of it, than they under <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> ſeeing the great advantage, or fruit, which we have made our buſineſs to reap from it, is, an open publiſhed <hi>Concord;</hi> a Concord, which ſome of the wiſeſt, both of Presbyterian and Independent have ſought formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der divers Conjunctures of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and could not obtain: A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, which the ſtrength in <hi>Union,</hi> the beauty in <hi>Truth,</hi> the life in <hi>Love,</hi> the intereſt in <hi>Number,</hi> the comfort in <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> do proclaim: A Bleſſing, which none of us are worthy of, and none can ſufficiently prize, but by a ſuitable endeavour to preſerve it.</p>
            <p>As for the Difference between ſome
<pb facs="tcp:107137:3"/>of us (which I would rather call a Contention only who ſhall be moſt Orthodox,) it is no Bone caſt among the Brethren (as ſome would ſuggeſt) to break our <hi>Union;</hi> for the Riſe of the <hi>Controverſie</hi> was before the <hi>Union.</hi> It was (we know) upon the Printing over again Dr. <hi>Criſps</hi> Works the <hi>Offence</hi> was <hi>given,</hi> or <hi>taken.</hi> The Dr. being a holy good man, there are ſeveral of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were willing to have them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly received: When <hi>Gataker,</hi> and others abroad, have branded them for <hi>Antinomianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, that freedom which <hi>England</hi> hath had (thoſe Diſputes a while lying dead) for ſome late Years from being exerciſed in <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi> Divinity, hath given occaſion to our Divines for their attending of <hi>Practical,</hi> which is much for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſeeing this <hi>Nation</hi> is, <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107137:4"/>allowed, above any, to excel: Nevertheleſs, while theſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies have ſlept, there are ſome, who think, the Enemy hath come, and ſowed <hi>Arminian, Socinian,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian TARES,</hi> and we by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe are hard put to it to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>them,</hi> and the <hi>Wheat;</hi> and conſequently by miſtake are loading one another with Charge of <hi>Errour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not like (I muſt confeſs) this <hi>Cenſorious</hi> Spirit, whereſoever I meet it: But the <hi>Zeal</hi> I find in our <hi>Brethren</hi> generally for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Doctrines according to the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Aſſemblies Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the like, againſt <hi>each</hi> of theſe <hi>Errours</hi> mentioned, (which we look on, really, as dangerous to mens Souls; and therefore are ſo ſhy of them) I do own and approve. And it is the very deſign therefore of my Writing, to
<pb facs="tcp:107137:4"/>Vindicate them herein, that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they differ in their Conceptions or Explications of the ſame <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> there are none of them truly chargeable with ſuch Errour, when they would faſten it one upon the other.</p>
            <p>I begin with <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> in theſe firſt Sheets, becauſe that gave the Occaſion; and the very ſame <hi>Method</hi> which you ſee me take in <hi>that,</hi> and I need not tell it, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to take alſo with <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I feel no delight in filling my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Quotations; but ſuch is the Nature of the Diſcourſe, that the many Authorities uſed for my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſatisfaction, became neceſſary, and muſt be my Apology.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE Churches Peace is a Bleſſing ſo very Great, and Valuable, that he, who ſets but a Right Eſtimate on its Real Worth, cannot think much to hazard even his own Private Quiet, Particular Intereſts, and Good Name, (which it is like to coſt him) to Obtain, or Defend it.</p>

               <p>To Prevent the Breach, or Heal it, when made, to procure Peace, and preſerve it when got, is a work attended with unaccountable Difficulties. There are ſuch Remainders of Pride and other Luſts in the Hearts of the beſt, that Satan no ſooner throws before them a Hurtful Temptation, but they catch at it. And it is ſo Natural for Learned and Pious Men to be Aſſuming and Dogmatical, that they can neither bear a Reproof, nor a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter; and others ſo full of Suſpition and Jealouſie, that Healing Attempts cannot eſcape the Cenſure of being Trick and Ill Deſign. There is ſuch a narrowneſs in the Minds of moſt, that they can't ſee any thing to be True or Good, but what falls within a very ſmall

               <p>Differences about Religious Matters have not been Confin'd to any one Party of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but have ſtretch'd themſelves to the utmoſt Bounds of Chriſtendom, ſo that no one Party can Upbraid the other with their Diviſions. We are ſo much in the Dark, that wherein we are Agreed <hi>de Re,</hi> we can't always Perceive it, ſo that many a time, when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, only <hi>de nomine,</hi> ariſes, we Purſue it as vehemently as if it had been <hi>Real.</hi> Men of the ſame Particular Denomination, are ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably ſuſpitious of one another, as to take it for granted, That every Obſcure or Unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Phraſe is Heterodox; whereas were we more Exact in our Diſquiſitions, more mindful of Humane Frailty, and more Compaſſionate and Charitable, we ſhould with Greater Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and more Juſtice Judge both of Perſons and Things, and find an Agreement much Greater than now we can Imagine it to be.</p>
               <p>To come more cloſe to the Controverſie before us, I am very ſenſible, that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Brethren, and ſome others, eſteem the Differences among us, being about the weightieſt Matters indeed of the Goſpel, to be ſuch that the Two Poles may as ſoon meet, as their Doctrines be found in <hi>Subſtance</hi> the ſame. The Noiſe, I confeſs, is, That the moſt Important Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, have receiv'd a Wound almoſt, if not altogether Incurable; But I muſt humbly crave leave to whiſper to the Reader, that I think otherwiſe, and do hold my ſelf in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity oblig'd to believe they mean the <hi>ſame thing</hi> for the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it. In my cloſeſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107137:13"/>Converſes with each Brother, He who ſeems to be moſt for the Exaltation of <hi>Free Grace,</hi> abhors nothing more than to give the Leaſt Encouragement to an Elect Perſon's Living in Sin, or Expecting an Enjoyment of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Glory, tho' he die under the Reigning Power of his Luſts, Unregenerate and finally Impenitent: And the other Brother, who ſo much preſſes the Neceſſity of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and a Holy Life, deteſts nothing ſo much as in any one Inſtance to Diminiſh the Glory of <hi>Free Grace,</hi> or to add any thing of our own to Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>Beſides, They have both Subſcrib'd the <hi>ſame</hi> Propoſitions, which do not only contain in them the <hi>Truths,</hi> about which the Conteſt hath been, but are ſo framed, as to <hi>Provide fully</hi> againſt the Errors, they have been ſuppoſed to Embrace. The Errors about which many have been Apprehenſive are the <hi>Antinomian, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Popiſh,</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Errors; all which, with the greateſt Caution Imaginable, are Really Renounced by the Subſcribers. Their <hi>Renunciation</hi> is ſo full, that there is no Room left them for coming off with that Diſtinction of Subſcribing them as Articles of <hi>Peace,</hi> and not of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of the Agreement are theſe, namely,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The Import therefore of the Subſcription to this Agreement can't be leſs than to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contained in theſe Propoſitions as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly true, according to the Word of God; and ſo Providing moſt fully againſt <hi>Antinomian, Arminian, Socinian</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Errors; and that even as a <hi>Rule,</hi> by which <hi>Our Sermons</hi> and <hi>Books</hi> are to <hi>be <hi>Iudged,</hi>

               <p>For this Reaſon, altho' it cannot be Denied but that many in their Oppoſition to <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm,</hi> have faln in with the <hi>Arminian,</hi> &amp;c. and that Divers in running from <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> &amp;c. have plung'd themſelves into the

                  <hi>Antinomian</hi> Gulph, and that they who bend their Strength againſt the one Error, are in danger of being accuſed for Inclining too much towards the other; yet in the Caſe before us, we are bound in Juſtice, according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our Brethren, to Judge and Interpret their Writings by the Subſcribed Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Tho' it may be Difficult to <hi>Conciliat</hi> ſome Expreſſions with theſe Articles, yet we muſt not charge them for holding Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines Contradictory unto them. The Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that is to be made for the Different Abilities, Educations, and Peculiar ways of Expreſſion, which ſome Men Uſe, will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Vindicate our Charity from being too Extenſive in this Matter.</p>
               <p>It is undoubtedly our Duty to forbear ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reflections, and hard Charges; to Lament our many weakneſſes, which make it very near an Impoſſibility for us to underſtand one another, and at the ſame time Adore the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace of God, that our Worthy Brethren, who have not been able to Agree, about the ſenſe of one anothers Writings, can Joyn in Subſcribing the ſame Doctrines, as Deliver'd by others.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. For Chriſt ſaith, Thus it behoved him to ſuffer, and Riſe again from the Dead, that <hi>Repentance,</hi> and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be Preached in his Name among all Nations.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And Chriſt in the Goſpel of <hi>John,</hi> ſaith, that the Spirit <hi>ſhall convince</hi> the World of Sin; <hi>Not the Law.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. The ſame is Taught in the Laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Chriſt, <hi>Go Preach the Goſpel to Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſaith, Let the ſame mind be in you, which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that with Fear and Trembling ye may work out your Salvation, which words do

                           <p n="6">6. From the Diſcourſes of <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> it ſufficiently appears, that, there is no need of the <hi>Law,</hi> for any One part of Juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. That without which, the Holy Spirit is given and Men are juſtified; is not neceſſary to be Taught, either for the Beginning, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or End of Juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. But the Holy Ghoſt of Old was given, and ſtill is, that Men might be Juſtified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, by the Goſpel of Chriſt alone.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Therefore it's not neceſſary to Teach the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> either for the <hi>Beginning, Middle,</hi> or <hi>End</hi> of Juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. The <hi>Major</hi> is evident from the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> mention.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. And we muſt Judge the <hi>Minor</hi> to be true,<note place="margin">

                           <p n="12">12. What ſhall we then ſay of ſome who without the Word, yea, Contrary to it, and the Example of the Apoſtles, do make the Law the <hi>firſt Part,</hi> yea, a <hi>Neceſſary</hi> one to the Doctrine of Juſtification.</p>

                           <p n="14">14.

                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Repentance,</hi> by the Teſtimony of all, and by what is undoubtedly <hi>True,</hi> is a <hi>Grief for Sin, with an adjoyned Purpoſe of a better Life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:107137:19"/>
                           <p n="2">2. This Grief, <hi>Properly,</hi> is not, nor can it be any thing elſe, than a deep ſence of the <hi>Law</hi> in the Heart or Conſcience.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. For, tho' many hear the Law, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not that ſenſe, nor feel the force of the Law, they Grieve not, nor Repent.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The <hi>firſt Part of</hi> Repentance, to wit, <hi>Grief is Only</hi> from the <hi>Law;</hi> The other part, namely, a <hi>Good Purpoſe,</hi> cannot be from the <hi>Law.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. For a man Terrified at the <hi>Sight of Sin,</hi> cannot, in his own Strength <hi>Purpoſe</hi> any good thing; for he is neither at <hi>Peace</hi> nor <hi>Safe:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6. But confounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and over-whelm'd by the Power of Sin, falls into <hi>Deſperation,</hi> and <hi>Hatred of God;</hi> or, (as the Holy Scriptures have it) Deſcends into Hell.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. To the <hi>Law</hi> therefore the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel</hi> is to be <hi>added,</hi> which do quiet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the terrified Conſcience, and broken Heart, that it may <hi>Purpoſe</hi> what is Good.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. That Repentance, which is <hi>Only</hi> from the <hi>Law,</hi> is but the <hi>half,</hi> or <hi>Beginning</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or Repentance by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is wanting the good Purpoſe.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. If it be Perſevered in, it becomes the Repentance of a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Saul,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> and of all ſuch as Diſtruſt of the Mercy of God, and <hi>Deſpair;</hi> that is to ſay, who Periſh.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Theſe <hi>Sophiſts</hi> learn't their Definition of <hi>Repentance,</hi> viz. That it is a <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> &amp;c. out of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="11">11. But they underſtand not the Terms of this their Definition, <hi>[Sorrow, Sin, Purpoſe]</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:107137:20"/>
                           <p n="19">19. Nor need we wonder at this their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for they neglecting and ſlighting the Scriptures, can't be thought to know, what is <hi>Law,</hi> or what <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="20">20. Indeed quite bound up in Humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Injunctions, they only Dream, when they Judge of Sacred, and Divine Things.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. But the Goſpel teaches us in Oppoſition to theſe Maſters of Deſpair, that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ought not to be a meer Horror and Deſpair.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. But that Penitents muſt hope and truſt, and hate Sin out of love to God, which is the only Good Temper and Purpoſe of Mind.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. This ſome, Unmindful of any Proofs or Reaſon, and indeed Heedleſs of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Hand, aſſert to be contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> of God:</p>
                           <p n="24">24. And very erroneouſly teach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Law of God is <hi>totally,</hi> and without any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions or Limitations to be taken out of the Church: which is Blaſphemous, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. But the Scriptures throughout inform us, that Repentance muſt be begun by the Law, which likewiſe, the Order and Nature of the thing it ſelf requires, and common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proves.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. They (<hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures) ſay, Let all them be turned into Hell who forget God: and, Set, O Lord, a Law-giver over them, that Men may know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p n="27">27. Fill their Faces with Shame, that they may ſeek thy Name, O Lord: and the Sinner is caught in the Works of his Hands.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. And this is the Stated Order, that Death and Sin are in us before Life and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. Nor are we <hi>now</hi> Righteous and Alive, to be delivered over to Sin and Death, but actually and in our Preſent State Sinners and Dead in <hi>Adam,</hi> to be Juſtified and made alive by Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. Wherefore we muſt be firſt taught the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> (i. e. Sin and Death) who is the Figure of him who was to come, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt, now in the ſecond Place to be Preach'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. Sin and Death muſt of Neceſſity be ſhown us out of the <hi>Law,</hi> and not by the Word of Grace, and Comfort.</p>
                           <p n="32">32. And experience clears it: <hi>Adam</hi> firſt ſtood convicted a Tranſgreſſor of the Law; was <hi>afterwards</hi> Reſtored to Hopes by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Seed of the Woman.</p>
                           <p n="33">33. And <hi>David,</hi> was firſt ſtruck dead by the Law, telling Him by <hi>Nathan, [Thou art he]</hi> is afterwards Saved by the Grace of the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>[Thou ſhalt not Die.]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="34">34. <hi>Paul</hi> trembling under <hi>Law-Stroaks,</hi> firſt heard, <hi>[Why Perſecuteſt thou me?] then</hi> was Enlivened and Quickned by the Goſpel, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. And Chriſt Himſelf ſays, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Believe the Goſpel, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. The Law is not only <hi>Not-neceſſary</hi> to Juſtification, but alſo manifeſtly Unprofitable and altogether Impoſſible.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And to them who keep the Law with a Reſpect to be Juſtified by it, it becomes as Poiſon and moſt Pernicious.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. When we diſcourſe of Juſtification, we cannot ſay too much of the Weakneſs of the Law, and againſt a moſt Dangerous Confidence in the Law.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Neither is the Law given that it may Juſtifie, or give Life, or any way to Help unto a Righteouſneſs.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. But to <hi>ſhew us Our ſin,</hi> work Wrath, and convince the Conſcience of our Guilt.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. In ſhort, Heaven is not more diſtant from the Earth, than the Law muſt be ſeparate from Juſtification.</p>
                           <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107137:21"/>
                           <p n="9">9. Nothing is to be taught, ſaid, or thought on in the Matter of Juſtification, but only the Word of Grace exhibited in Chriſt:</p>
                           <p n="10">10. And yet nevertheleſs it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Law is to be aboliſhed, and not to be Preached in the Church.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. But it is the more needful it ſhould be taught, by being Uſeleſs, nay, Impoſſible for Juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. That ſo, Proud Man, confident of his Abilities may be inſtructed that he cannot be Juſtified by the Law.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. For Sin and Death are therefore to be ſhown us; not that they are Neceſſary for Life and Innocence.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. But that Man may be ſenſible of his Unrighteouſneſs, and loſt State, and ſo be <hi>humbled.</hi>

                           <p n="15">15. If we ſee not our Sin, we conceit our ſelves Innocent: as is viſible in the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="16">16. If Death were unknown to us, this Life would be the only Life to us, nor ſhould we look for a future one.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. But ſince both are taught us only by the <hi>Law,</hi> it is evident, that the Law is very Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and Profitable.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. Whatever ſhews us Sin, Wrath, or Death, that belongs to the Law, whether it be in the Old, or New Teſtament.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. A Diſcovery of Sin cannot be but by the <hi>Law,</hi> and is its proper Effect and Force.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. The Law, Manifeſtation of Sin, and Revelation of Wrath are Reciprocal Terms,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107137:22"/>as much as Man, and Riſible, or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. To take away the Law, and Retain the Revelation of Wrath, is as if one ſhould Deny <hi>Peter</hi> to be a Man, and yet affirm Him to be a <hi>Riſible, Rational Creature.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="22">22. After the ſame ſort, do they Reaſon, who take away the Law, and then hold that Sin remains to be forgiven.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. Whereas the Holy Spirit in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach, that <hi>Sin is Dead without the Law; and where there is no Law, there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi>

               <p>On this <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> between the <hi>Sin,</hi> and its <hi>Guilt,</hi> the Reformed do <hi>found</hi> that other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> holding, that Juſtification imports only an Outward and Relative Change, whereby the Soul is freed from <hi>Guilt,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Again, if Guilt be <hi>Inſeparable</hi> from the Sin, there can be no taking away the Guilt by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but the Sin it ſelf, the Fault ceaſeth to be, and conſequently, if the Sin of our Nature,

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Agreement</hi> between the <hi>Antinomian, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> about the <hi>Inſeparableneſs</hi> of the <hi>Sin it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>Guilt,</hi> is not only Inconſiſtent with the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> but ſtrikes at the very Root of Chriſt's Satisfaction. A Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Tranſlation or Transfuſion of Sin from One to another, being Naturally and Spiritually Impoſſible, there can be no Imputing the Guilt, nor Inflicting the Puniſhment of our Sins on Chriſt. The Links of the Chain lye thus: If Chriſt did not endure the Puniſhment, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107137:31"/>for our Sins, he could not make Satisfaction for them; If the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin was not Imputed, the Puniſhment could not be Juſtly inflicted; If the <hi>Guilt</hi> be <hi>Inſeparable</hi> from the Sin it ſelf, and <hi>that</hi> Impoſſible to Paſs from us to Chriſt (as really it is) the Guilt cannot be Imputed. Thus if no Guilt be Imputed, no Puniſhment can be by a Righteous God Inflicted; if no Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment Inflicted, nor Suffering for our Sins, no Satisfaction can be made. And if Salvation may be without Satisfaction, what need of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God?</p>
               <p>This Aſſertion then, that the Sin it ſelf, and Guilt are Inſeparable, doth not only give Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Papist</hi> by confounding Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Sanctification; but to the <hi>Arminian,</hi> in making it Impoſſible for the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin to be Imputed unto his Poſterity; and to the <hi>Socinian</hi> by ſubverting Chriſt's Satisfaction, neceſſarily driving Men, either into the Horror of <hi>Deſpair,</hi> or into <hi>Libertine</hi> Practices.</p>
               <p>If Guilt be Inſeparable from the Sin it ſelf,<note place="margin">The Guilt of Sin is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reſpect of it, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Sanction of the Law <hi>only.</hi> This is <hi>SEPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE</hi> from Sin, if <hi>IT WERE NOT SO,</hi> no <hi>One Sinner could either</hi> be <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,</hi> or <hi>Saved.</hi> Dr. <hi>O.</hi> of Juſtif. <hi>ub. ſup.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But if on the other hand, we ſuppoſe, the Pardon of Sin Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, notwithſtanding Guilt is made Inſeparable from the Sin, it muſt then be Granted, that when ever the Guilt is Removed, and the Sin Pardoned, the Sin it ſelf is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, It's formal Nature is taken away and what Leudneſs ſoever they Commit, there is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107137:31"/>no Sin in them. All Sin, Paſt, Preſent, and to Come, being (as they hold) forgiven them, there is no Sin in their <hi>Drunkenneſs, Murder,</hi> or <hi>Adultery.</hi> They may do what they liſt, they may Rob, Plunder, Oppreſs the Fatherleſs and Widow, commit Sodomy and all the Outrages Imaginable; but according to this Principle, Sin they cannot, than which what Greater En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement can there be given to <hi>Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm?</hi>
               </p>

And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that not only the Puniſhment and Guilt of Sin, but moreover the <hi>Sin it ſelf,</hi> was laid on Chriſt; the worſt of <hi>Popery, Arminianiſm, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Libertine</hi> Abominations flow from it; And, the other Parts of their <hi>Scheme</hi> are of the ſame kind, as I will endeavor Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to Evince.</p>

If Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication be before Faith; then, nor Unbelief, nor any other obſtinate Reigning Sin, can be a Bar unto it. The Abſence of what follows Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation cannot hinder your being Juſtified; for your being Juſtified before <hi>it,</hi> neceſſarily infers your Juſtification in the Abſence thereof, which therefore can be no <hi>Impediment,</hi> or <hi>Hindrance</hi> unto it. And if, on the Abſence of Faith,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107137:32"/>Juſtification is not ſuſpended, But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Reigning Power of Unbelief and other Luſts the Sinner is Juſtified, what need of Preaching the Goſpel; Or, of what Uſe can Goſpel-Promiſes be to any? Whether the Elect be <hi>troubled</hi> for Sin, or <hi>not,</hi> they are by theſe Men placed in a very ſafe State, as free from <hi>Wrath,</hi> as the <hi>Saint</hi> in Glory; But if any ſuch be <hi>troubled,</hi> what is there in the Promiſe for their Comfort? or, what Right, what Title, what Intereſt hath any Man of a Troubled or Diſtreſſed Conſcience, in a Promiſe? He knows not to whom the Promiſe doth belong, and therefore can't ſay, he hath any Title to it. If it be ſaid, It belongs to the <hi>Elect,</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> this can't help him, nor remove the Cauſe of his Sorrow. He Believes it ſhall be well with the Elect, but knows not that he is Elected. He is rather afraid he is not, what then muſt he do for Comfort? Muſt he look into his own heart, and try himſelf by marks, and ſigns? Muſt he Enquire, whether he hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Sin, humbled in the ſence of the Evils thereof, ſenſible of his Loſt Eſtate out of Chriſt, and of a Neceſſity of cloſing with him on his own Terms? No, This is too much, for it's, <hi>Legale,</hi> and diſpoſes Men to make a Chriſt of their own Righteouſneſs. Muſt they Repent, and Believe, that they may be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? There are many Elect Perſons who can't ſee they have Repented, or Believed. They have no Faith they are ſure, and how ſhall they be Comforted? For the Comfort of theſe, the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Declares, The want of Faith can be no Bar to their Juſtification, or Pardon,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107137:32"/>that the Promiſe is made to <hi>Sinners,</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> as they are <hi>Sinners,</hi> and that no one Sin, or many Sins, how Obſtinate ſoever, can hinder their Intereſt in the Promiſe. Are they Sinners? that can't be denied; It's then, (they ſay) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. Let them come to Chriſt, Let them Come, tho' under the Reigning Power of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and Unbelief; Let them come to Chriſt, and be Comforted; Let them be but perſwaded that their Sins are Pardoned, and it is ſo; for the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is to <hi>Sinners</hi> as <hi>Sinners,</hi> and therefore to all and every Sinner.</p>
               <p>This is the Duty (they ſay) of every Man to look on the Promiſe, as made unto them, that is, All muſt believe, that their Sins are Pardoned, becauſe the Promiſe is unto all, which cannot be, Unleſs <hi>All</hi> be <hi>Redeemed.</hi> The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin is not given to any but ſuch as are Redeemed. If all muſt believe, that their Sins are Pardoned, becauſe the Promiſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is to all Sinners, as ſuch, then all are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, then all are Redeemed.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the Reaſon, why <hi>Hoornbeek</hi> charges the Engliſh <hi>Antinomian,</hi> with holding <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption;</hi> to which their Third <hi>Principle</hi> is Conform.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Promiſe,</hi> being made to the Sinner, <hi>as he is a Sinner,</hi> and therefore to every Sinner, he may, whilſt he is a Sinner, apply the Promiſe, as well as when a Believer, or indeed <hi>rather bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:107137:33"/>becauſe the Promiſe belongs not to him, as he is a <hi>Believer;</hi> but, as he is a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and yet the Promiſe belonging to him as he is a Sinner, he muſt be in Covenant, for the Extent of the Promiſe is not, nor can be any larger than <hi>that</hi> of the Covenant, and being in Covenant, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Saving Benefits, they muſt be <hi>United</hi> unto Chriſt whilſt Sinners.

               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon is manifeſt. The Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made to <hi>Sinners,</hi> as <hi>Sinners,</hi> their Comforts, and Aſſurances muſt ariſe from the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their being <hi>Sinners;</hi> and not from their Grief for Sin, their Repentance, or Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107137:33"/>being unto them, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> their Comforts, and Aſſurances muſt ariſe from them.</p>
               <p>But of what uſe then is the <hi>Law?</hi> It is of none, eſpecially unto Believers, or Regenerate Perſons, as is held by them in their Sixth <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Moral Law muſt not be Preached to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and Regenerate Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might have been added by them, that the Preaching of the Law is of no uſe at all unto <hi>any;</hi> For Sin, and Guilt being made by them Inſeparable from One another, the Guilt being, in Pardon, Removed, whil'ſt Unregenerate, and under the Power of Unbelief. there is no Sin left in them; No formal Sins to Repent of, which makes the Preaching of the Law to be altogether Uſeleſs unto <hi>

               <p>This Particular Account of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errors, which is taken from the Reports made of them by the Greateſt Adverſaries to <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm, Popery,</hi> or <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> is (as every body may ſee) directly oppoſite to the Doctrinal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and <hi>Savoy Confeſſions,</hi> the <hi>Larger,</hi> and <hi>Shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Catechiſms,</hi> and Undoubtedly nothing more Deteſted by our Reverend Brethren, than theſe Abominations.

               <p>That all the <hi>Elect</hi> are given unto Chriſt, is manifeſtly True, but their <hi>Right</hi> Reſults from their being <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, who as ſuch have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made unto them.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note>

Tho' <hi>Virtually</hi> and <hi>Seminally,</hi> in different Reſpects, an Elect Perſon may be conſidered, as the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Second Adam;</hi> and when actually a Deſcendant from the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> he may be look'd on as <hi>Virtually</hi> the Seed of the Second: yet <hi>Actually,</hi> he cannot be at the ſame time the <hi>Seed of both.</hi> On his being born of Chriſt he ceaſeth to be a Child of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and of Wrath, but not till then; He muſt be actually a Deſcendant from the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and be by Faith United unto Chriſt, before he can be actually Juſtified, which is a Truth, that ſtrikes at the very Sinews of <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To affirm, <q>That <hi>not only the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> but the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin was laid on Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>not Antinomianiſm.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> will have it, that Chriſt bore the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of our Sin, but not the <hi>Guilt.</hi> The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who ſee the Connection there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Guilt and Puniſhment, how that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Puniſhment is Juſtly laid, there <hi>Guilt</hi> muſt be, are Poſitive, that nor the <hi>Guilt</hi> nor the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Sin</hi> was on Chriſt. The Guilt, and Puniſhment are Relatives,<note place="margin">Relative enim ſunt Paena &amp; Delictum: ita ut ubi delictum non eſt, ibi poena eſſe nullomoda poſſit. Socin. de Servat. Part <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> ſo that where no Guilt, there (ſaith <hi>Socinus</hi>) no Puniſhment can be. And it muſt be yielded. That Puniſhment hath an Eſſential reſpect unto Sin, it muſt be <hi>for Sin,</hi> or it cannot be Puniſhment; and it cannot be for Sin on whom no Sin is, either <hi>Inhaerently;</hi> Or, by <hi>Imputation.</hi> Sin Inherently could not be in him, who knew no Sin. Nor can there be the Imputation of Sin, but by transferring its <hi>Guilt</hi> unto him.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt <hi>ſuffer'd,</hi> was <hi>wounded,</hi> and bruiſed for <hi>our Sins</hi> is in too many Places, throughout the Holy Scriptures, aſſerted, to admit of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. But Chriſt could not <hi>juſtly</hi> ſuffer for our Sins, unleſs in a ſound ſence, he bore the <hi>Guilt</hi> of them. To Puniſh the Innocent as Innocent, is Injuſtice. Jeſus Chriſt therefore tho' Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in himſelf, voluntarily becoming our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, took on him the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin, and ſuffer'd <hi>Juſtly;</hi> becauſe as being <hi>Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:107137:38"/>
               <p>To clear this, is the Difficulty, and many, in the Attempt, fall into dangerous Miſtakes. They who make Sin and Guilt the ſame thing, by aſſerting the Guilt to be laid on Chriſt, <hi>Quantum in ſe,</hi> do make Chriſt <hi>Inherently</hi> a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is <hi>Antinomianiſm;</hi> and they, who ſay the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of Sin was laid on Chriſt, but not the Guilt, give up the Cauſe to the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian;</hi> For if not the Guilt, then nor the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; whence no Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Guilt</hi> lyeth between the <hi>Sin</hi> and its <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> It is an Obnoxiouſneſs unto Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>Sin;</hi> which, as it Reſults from the <hi>Sin,</hi> or <hi>Fault,</hi> is called the <hi>Guilt</hi> of the <hi>Fault;</hi> But, as it reſpects the Puniſhment, being an Obligation thereunto 'tis <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Guilt is not <hi>Intrinſick</hi> to the <hi>Sin;</hi> The Sin is Entire without it; It is only an <hi>External</hi> reſpect of it to the Sanction of the Law, and <hi>Separable</hi> from the Sin it ſelf, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo that tho' the Sin Remain in us, the Guilt Paſſeth from us to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Entire Nature of Sin lyeth in a Reſpect unto the Preceptive Part of the Law, being (as hath been already Obſerved) a Tranſgreſſion, or a Want of Conformity unto it. The Sin, is in its <hi>Formal Nature,</hi> Entire, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>Sanction.</hi> From this <hi>Sin,</hi> as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>Threatning,</hi> Reſults <hi>Guilt;</hi> which is an Obnoxiouſneſs unto Puniſhment; or, the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas Paenae propter Culpam,</hi> and is Extrinſick to the Sin, ſeparable from it, and may be laid on him, who never tranſgreſs'd the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor can it <hi>morally</hi> Defile, or Pollute the Perſon on whom it is laid.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT is not <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> to Deny the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality</hi> of <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not, it may be, any one Point in the Body of Divinity of greater Difficulty than this about the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and its <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality.</hi> They that ſearch deeply into the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Controverſies agitated between <hi>us,</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. Arminian, Socinian,</hi> and <hi>Antinomian;</hi> will find that the moſt Important Parts of it Turn on this <hi>Hinge.</hi> The <hi>Papist, Arminian,</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> cannot ſee, how the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> could be made with Jeſus Chriſt, as a <hi>Second Adam;</hi> and with the <hi>Elect,</hi> as <hi>his Seed,</hi> which is One Reaſon of their many Miſtakes. And the <hi>Antinomian</hi> fixeth his thoughts ſo very much on the <hi>Covenant of Grace's</hi> being made with Chriſt, that there is no Room left him to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how it can be made alſo with his Seed; which occaſions their Aſſerting, That Chriſt perform'd the <hi>whole</hi> requir'd of us in order to our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107137:39"/>being actually Intereſted in him, and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; as well as make <hi>Satisfaction</hi> by his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and <hi>Merit</hi> by his Righteouſneſs for them that Believe: That Chriſt Believed, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented for us, as if there had been no other Reaſon for our Doing either, than to Obtain the Knowledge of our having what actually was ours, whilſt under the Power of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> and <hi>Impenitency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, it not being my Province to enter on a Large Debate of theſe things, I will only ſhow, that there are ſuch <hi>Senſes,</hi> in which the word <hi>[Condition]</hi> is uſed by the <hi>Papiſts, Arminian,</hi> and <hi>Socinian,</hi> as do Confound <hi>Goſpel Grace</hi> with the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> and eſtabliſh <hi>Merit; Deſtroy the Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Spirits working the <hi>Firſt</hi> Grace;</hi> and <hi>ſubvert Chriſt's ſatisfaction,</hi> and ſo make it Evident, That One, who Deteſts <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> may yet Deny the <hi>Conditionality</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the word <hi>[Condition]</hi> when ſpoken of the <hi>Two Covenants,</hi> namely, of <hi>Works,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> be taken in the <hi>ſame</hi> ſence in both, the one will be Confounded with the other.</p>
               <p>To Evince thus much, I will ſhow the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> and how it agrees with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Merit,</hi> and leave it to the Judgment of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader to conſider the <hi>Truth</hi> of my Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant of Works is <hi>ea res, quae Praeſtita, dat Jus ad Praemium.</hi> It is that Obedience, to which the Promiſe was made; and from the Performance of which, a Right to the Reward immediately Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107137:40"/>and <hi>for</hi> which, in Juſtice, <hi>it</hi> is <hi>due.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Condition,</hi> being Perfect Obedience, was to a <hi>Law,</hi> enforc'd with <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,</hi> which Obedience, the Reward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming due to it, <hi>ex Juſtitia,</hi> is <hi>Meritorious.</hi> And as, on the Rendring the Required Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Reward is Juſtly Due; ſo, ſeeing the <hi>Performance</hi> of the <hi>Condition,</hi> is the ſame with the Render of Perfect Obedience, the Bleſſing Promiſed is thereon Juſtly due unto it; and the Performing the Condition is <hi>meritorious,</hi> for Merit is nothing but that <hi>Actio quâ Juſtum eſt, ut Agenti aliquid Detur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is much, much variety (I muſt confeſs) amongſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in ſtating their Doctrine of <hi>Merit,</hi> but the Prevailing Opinion is,<note place="margin">Meritum &amp; Merc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>The <hi>Objection</hi> that lyeth againſt them is this, If the Meritorious Act be <hi>ſo,</hi> only from the Divine Promiſe, or God's Gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, then the Reward can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>ex Juſtitiâ,</hi> the good Work may be done, and God not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd in <hi>Juſtice</hi> to give the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The utmoſt that can be ſaid is this, God in <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> is bound by his Promiſe to Reward the Doer, but not in <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and yet unleſs God be in <hi>Juſtice</hi> bound, the Work cannot be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious <hi>ex Condigno.</hi> To this Objection their Anſwer (as I find it in <hi>Sancta Clara</hi>) is, that the fulfilling a <hi>Naked Promiſe,</hi> is only an Act of <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs:</hi> But, the fulfilling a <hi>Covenant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> which is made on <hi>Condition,</hi> as between a Maſter and Servant, where the Maſter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes a Reward on <hi>Condition</hi> of ſuch a Service, here, for the Maſter to fulfil the Promiſe to his Servant on his Performing the <hi>Condition,</hi> is an Act of Juſtice, which is (ſay they) our Caſe.</p>
               <p>Thus to make good Works meritorious, they aſſert a <hi>Law,</hi> with a Promiſe; making the Dignity of the Work to lean on the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> And that the Reward may be Due <hi>ex ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> is turn'd into a <hi>Covenant,</hi> where
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107137:44"/>Obedience to the Preceptive Part is made the <hi>Condition,</hi> that giveth Right to the Reward. So that it is that <hi>Conditionality</hi> of the Covenant, on which the <hi>Merit of Condignity</hi> is Founded. All which is undoubtedly true of the Covenant given <hi>Adam.</hi> For if he had but rendred the Perfect Obedience required by the Preceptive Part of the Law; or, which is the ſame, if he had Perform'd the <hi>Condition</hi> of that Covenant made with him; it would have given him a <hi>Right</hi> to the Reward, it would have been in <hi>Juſtice</hi> due to him, that is, he would have <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited</hi> it <hi>Ex Condigno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' his <hi>Temporary</hi> Obedience fell infinitely ſhort of the Reward of <hi>Eternal</hi> Life; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Promiſe made on a <hi>Covenant-Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> giving Right; the Reward, on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Condition, would have been <hi>Due</hi> to him <hi>ex juſtitia</hi> (i. e.) he would have merited it <hi>Ex Condigno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, if the word <hi>[Condition]</hi> when aſſign'd to the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> be taken in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>that thing, which, being Perform'd, gives <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Reward,</hi>
                  </hi> the Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi> is Confounded with that of <hi>Works,</hi> and <hi>Merit of Condignity</hi> effectually eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>'Tis Confounded with the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and made a Covenant of the <hi>ſame kind</hi> with it, for in both, as there is a <hi>Precept</hi> enjoyning Duty, and a Promiſe of <hi>Reward;</hi> even ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Work falls infinitely ſhort of the <hi>Reward,</hi> yet the Reward being Promiſed on a <hi>Condition,</hi> giving Right; A Right unto it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from the Performance of the <hi>Condition,</hi> and the Reward is due <hi>ex juſtitia,</hi> and ſo Merit of <hi>Condignity</hi> is alſo eſtabliſhed.</p>

                  </note> they thus argue againſt <hi>Chriſt's Meriting</hi> Faith and <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> for the Elect. <q>If Chriſt merited Faith, and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us, (ſay they) then Faith cannot be a <hi>Condition,</hi> which God exacts from Sinners, under the Commination of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Death.

Again they add, That the Preſcription of a <hi>Condition,</hi> and an Efficacious working it in them to whom it is preſcrib'd, are Incompatible. <hi>That Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is not a <hi>Condition,</hi>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107137:52"/>Principal Cauſe of our Juſtification, is by the Non-Performance of Faith ſuſpended, and ſo long we remain <hi>Unjuſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath pleaſed God to fix ſuch an Order in the Diſpenſation of his Bleſſings, that the one neceſſarily antecedes the other, and what goeth before another hath an Influence upon that other, as it is <hi>ſo</hi> ſetled, and eſtabliſh'd by the Ordinance of God. Not that the former gives <hi>Right</hi> unto the latter; but ſo it is appointed of God, that ſuch an Order be obſerved in the diſpoſing of theſe Bleſſings, that he who has not the firſt, ſhall not have the ſecond; He that hath not Faith ſhall not be Juſtified.</p>
               <p>But whether it be a <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> Or, a Condition in this Covenant; Or only a Condition of our Juſtification, tho' our Divines have different Sentiments about it, yet 'tis generally held, that Faith is a <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>Juſtification.</hi> They that ſcruple the uſe of the Word, own the thing ſignified thereby.</p>
               <p>The Learned Author of <hi>Anti-ſozzo</hi> ſaith, that Faith is a Condition <hi>in</hi> the Covenant of Grace, tho' not <hi>of</hi> it, and they, who hold, that the Covenant of Grace was made with Chriſt as a <hi>Second Adam,</hi> do aſſert, that it is alſo made with the Faithful, the <hi>Members</hi> of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Diſcourſe of the two Covenants, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 162.</note> for which the Judicious Mr, <hi>Strong</hi> gives ſeveral Reaſons; namely, <q>That the Saints may ſee that they are as ſtrictly <hi>bound to Obedience</hi> in their own Perſons under the <hi>Second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> as they were, under the <hi>First.</hi> And that the Doctrine of the Goſpel, tho' it be a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Liberty,</hi> is not a Doctrine of <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs;</hi> and that they may ſtand in <hi>awe of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107137:52"/>Threats</hi> of God. This Doctrine (ſaith he) I do the rather pitch upon in Oppoſition to the <hi>Licentious Tenent</hi> of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who ſay, that all is Required of Chriſt, and nothing of Us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Notion of a <hi>Condition,</hi> as it doth moſt fully Provide againſt <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> by Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Neceſſity of Faith's being in Order of Nature before Juſtification; ſo, it doth as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſecure us from the <hi>Popiſh, Arminian,</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Rocks, in that it is not a <hi>Legal,</hi> but a <hi>Teſtamentary <hi>Condition,</hi>
                  </hi> that cannot Eſtabliſh the <hi>Merit</hi> of Good Works, nor Interfere with Chriſt's <hi>meriting,</hi> or the Spirits working the Firſt Grace; nor Subvert the Doctrine of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> or Particular Election. All Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Diſpoſitions, whatever be the <hi>Modes</hi> of Donation, are of Free Grace, not of <hi>Metit,</hi> and being Given to us, as the Children of a <hi>Testator,</hi> the Merit and Gift of the Firſt Grace, which is neceſſary to our being ſuch Children, cannot be Deſtroyed by ſuch a <hi>Modus,</hi> or Condition.</p>
               <p>Theſe things will Appear with much more Clearneſs if we conſider, that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Repreſent Chriſt as a <hi>Second-Adam;</hi> the Father of a <hi>Spiritual Off-ſpring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things Chriſt did, as a <hi>Second-Adam.</hi> He undertook to <hi>beget</hi> a <hi>Seed,</hi> and Raiſe that <hi>Seed</hi> unto Glory. This Seed Chriſt Purchaſed, and on his Purchaſe they are given him by the Father according to the terms Agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father, and the Son in the Eternal Compact.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt begets a Seed, and by his Word and Spirit Governs, and Raiſes them unto
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107137:53"/>Glory, is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with his <hi>Meriting,</hi> and <hi>Giving</hi> the <hi>First</hi> Grace, that it is in Purſuance of it. Chriſt merited a Seed; and, that he may have what he merited, a <hi>Seed</hi> is Given him; which is by the <hi>Fathers drawing,</hi> the <hi>Sons gathering,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits working Grace in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt alſo, as a <hi>Second-Adam,</hi> made ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his Children; who, as ſoon as they do ſpiritually by Regeneration Deſcend from him, have a Right to Impunity. If the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction had been made by Chriſt, as a Mediator <hi>for the Elect, as ſuch,</hi> then indeed, as ſoon as they had any Being, they would have been Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd from the Debt. But Chriſt making Satisfaction for the Elect as <hi>his Seed,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not partake of the Right reſulting from it, but as they become his Seed. As they are his Seed <hi>Virtually,</hi> they have a <hi>Virtual</hi> Diſcharge; but an <hi>Actual</hi> Diſcharge, they cannot have, till they are <hi>Actually</hi> born again.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> being made with Chriſt, as a <hi>Second-Adam,</hi> the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are made unto Chriſt, as the Reward of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but <hi>for his Seed;</hi> ſo that in Chriſt you muſt be by Faith, that you may be Pardoned, and Saved; and yet your Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Reſults not from your <hi>Faith;</hi> but from <hi>Christ's Righteouſneſs:</hi> whereby, it's manifeſt, that Goſpel-Promiſes are Powerful Motives to Engage us to do our utmoſt to Believe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and muſt be Preached to this Very-End, and Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Thus the Doctrine of our <hi>Merit</hi> is laid by, Chriſt's meriting and working the Firſt Grace,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107137:53"/>and his making Satisfaction to God's Juſtice, and the neceſſity of our Faith, Repentance and Sanctification are abundantly cleared by this Goſpel-Repreſentation, that is made of Chriſt, as he is a <hi>Second Adam,</hi> with whom the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is made, and with his <hi>Seed,</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> which is ſo far from deſtroying <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Election,</hi> that it eſtabliſheth it. For the <hi>Elect</hi> were Promiſed unto Chriſt, merited by him, and given unto him, as the Reward of his Sufferings, whereby it is made <hi>ſure;</hi> that the Death of Chriſt ſhall not be altogether in vain. He ſhall ſee the <hi>Elect</hi> as the Travel of his Soul, and be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Thus as in Oppoſition to <hi>Popery, Arminianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm, Legal Conditions</hi> are Juſtly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; ſo in Contradiction to the <hi>Antinomian Error</hi> Teſtamentary Conditions are here expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and aſſerted.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Antinomians,</hi> (I mean ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo) have had too much Honour given them by ſuch as Grant, that their Notion about <hi>Faith</hi> is ſupported by the Suffrage of the <hi>Firſt-Reformers:</hi> Whereas, on a Diligent ſearch, 'twill Appear, that the Difference between them is very great; the <hi>Antinomians</hi> holding Actual Juſtification in the Sight of God to be before Faith, and the <hi>Others</hi> Deny it.</p>
               <p>To Vindicate the Firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> from this Unjuſt Charge, I will impartially propoſe what they held of it, and ſhow, how they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107137:54"/>the <hi>Papiſts, Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> and wherein they differ from the <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Account they give of Faith is the ſame with what I have laid down, they make it to be a Firm Perſwaſion, wrought in the Heart of Man, that his Sins are forgiven him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> defines it thus. <q>Faith is a Firm, and Certain Knowledge,<note place="margin">Fides eſt firma, &amp; certa co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatio, ſeu <hi>fiducia</hi> de Deo, quod per Chriſtum ſit Propitius, quod per Chriſtum Cogitet de nobis Cogitationes pacis, non irae.

               <p>

The <hi>first Diſpoſitive,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I believe, that Chriſt hath merited the Pardon of Sin for <hi>them,</hi> that are his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> is <hi>formally Juſtificatory,</hi> whereby I, who am now Sorrowing for my Sin, and Purpoſing Amendment of Life do believe, that all my Sins are at this preſent Forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The <hi>Third Conſolatory</hi> whereby I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all my Sins <hi>have been Pardoned,</hi> and that I ſhall never more be in a State of Condemnation. In the <hi>Firſt</hi> ſenſe, Faith is <hi>before</hi> Juſtification. In the <hi>Second, Simul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous</hi> with it; In the <hi>Third,</hi> it followeth it. <hi>Paraeus</hi> expreſſeth himſelf to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Before</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> of Juſtification, (that is to ſay, in order of Nature, not of time) Our <hi>Faith</hi> or Perſwaſion hath for its Object this Propoſition, <hi>de futuro,</hi> [<hi>My Sins <hi>ſhall</hi>

                     </note> why they define Juſtifying Faith by an Act that doth not really juſtifie, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Juſtification, rather than by an <hi>Act,</hi> by which we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? It ſeems very evident, they were induced thereunto by theſe conſiderations; namely, That that laſt Act praeſuppoſes the former, and doth more clearly explicate the entire nature of Faith, and contribute more to the comfort of Believers. In a word; this Aſſurance of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107137:61"/>pardon of ſin was the more inſiſted on by the Reformers, becauſe ſo much oppoſed by the Papiſts, with whom the Controverſie then moſtly was. So far <hi>Le Blank.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To give a more particular Account of the the Leſſer Differences among the Firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, as well as among our Modern Divines, and ſhow how they variouſly explicated the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, being more to gratifie the <hi>Curioſity</hi> of ſome, than ſatisfie the Conſciences of any, I will wave it, and go on to</p>
               <p>The ſecond; That many <hi>Fears and Doubts are conſiſtent with Juſtifying Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' they made Juſtifying Faith to be a firm perſwaſion of the pardon of ſin, yet they meant not ſuch a perſwaſion as was ſo excluſive of all Doubts and Fears about our Salvation, that whoever in the leaſt doubted, was deſtitute of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Amés</hi>) as to the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it, doth not always accompany Faith: For, it may be, and often is, either through the weakneſs of Judgment, or by reaſon of many Temptations and Troubles of Spirit, that he, who ſavingly believes, and is by Faith juſtified in the ſight of God, may, for a time, judging of himſelf by what he <hi>feels,</hi> conclude that he neither ſavingly believes, nor is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much the Dr. adds immediately after he had told us, that many who were Orthodox deſcribed Faith by a perſwaſion of the Grace and Mercy of God in Chriſt, whereby he ſeems to inſinuate a diſtinction to be between the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107137:62"/>
                  <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> of Pardon, and the ſenſe of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion; as if they who had not the ſenſe of it might yet have the perſwaſion. And it muſt be granted, that there is ſomewhat of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obvious to the Experience of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who are moſt converſant with troubled Conſciences. For, it is commonly obſerved by them, that godly perſons, even when under the Horror of Deſpair, crying out, <hi>They ſhall be damned;</hi> if asked, whether they will part with what Intereſt they have in Chriſt, will anſwer, they'll not do it for a World; which intimates, as if they had a ſecret perſwaſion of pardon, tho' they wanted a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it; which the firſt Reformers explained by diſtinguiſhing between the <hi>Habit,</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of Saving Faith. <q>True Juſtifying Faith (ſay they) may be taken in a two-fold ſenſe:
<list>
                        <item>1. For the <hi>Habit</hi> it ſelf, or for that power which is by the Holy Ghoſt infuſed into the hearts of the Elect.</item>
                        <item>Or 2. For the <hi>Act,</hi> which proceeds from that <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Habit</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> by which we are ſaid <hi>Actually</hi> to believe in Chriſt: Or that by which we do by an actual perſwaſion believe in him.</item>
                     </list> That Faith in Scripture is oft ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for an <hi>Act,</hi> no one doubts: That it is an Habit, Power or Quality, thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures evince, which ſay, <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith:</hi> And, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> For the Juſt, when aſleep, and by an actual Faith, think not on Chriſt, do yet then live by Faith, and pleaſe God. Faith is alſo in the Scriptures call'd, <hi>Science, Knowledge,</hi> a <hi>full Perſwaſion;</hi> all which reſide in the heart, when we do not actually think
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107137:62"/>of God. As <hi>Scientia</hi> is by Philoſophers put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the praedicament of Quality. Thus a <hi>Child,</hi> in whom can be no <hi>Acts</hi> of Knowledge, Senſe or Perſwaſion has yet the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Habit of Faith,</hi> as <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Learned do confeſs;</hi> particularly <hi>Martin Bucer.</hi>
                  </q> Beſides, they are very particular and diſtinct in their Endeavours to make it manifeſt that Faith, and Fears are conſiſtent. For they ſuppoſe Faith to be oft conflicting with Doubts and Fears, which they, to continue the uſe of <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s words, thus ſolve: <q>There is no abſurdity in aſſerting Faith to be a firm Perſwaſion, and yet the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever diſturb'd with afflictive doubts; for there being in ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107137:63"/>ſo, as to prevent the deſpair of ſuch, who, tho' ſound Believers, were afflicted with many fears and doubts about the pardon of their ſins, and their intereſt in the Mercy of God. They inſiſted on a perſwaſion, a firm belief of the forgiveneſs of ſins; but on ſuch a perſwaſion as admitting of different degrees was in many ſo weak and feeble, as not to be always <hi>perceptible.</hi> A Notion, as they explicated it, eaſie enough to be underſtood. For in other Inſtances, what more common than to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Habits?</hi> That the <hi>Acts</hi> are ſeen, when the <hi>Habits</hi> from whence they flow lies undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. Every one <hi>knows</hi> whether he believes this or the other Report; loves this, or the other perſon; as well as whether he ſeeth this, or the other Object. The Acts of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Rational Appetite, when exerted, are as perceivable in their way, as our Senſitive Acts. But then it ſhould be minded, that theſe Acts are oft look'd upon in their Habits, and when actuated, are commonly blended with ſuch other as are converſant about contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Objects, and their prevalence over theſe other ſo inconſiderable, that it's not at all times diſcernable, to which if we add, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World's Allurements, Satan's many ſubtle Temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it cannot but be that true Believers fall into great perplexities about the forgiveneſs of their ſins; which tho' great, deſtroy not their Faith, nor are they incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this firm perſwaſion. Strong fears, and many doubts may conſiſt with a moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the ſame Truths. How many have a moral certainty of the Immortality of their

               <p>This very Point the Learned Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in diſcourſe with me did thus illuſtrate: It is (ſaith he) as with a Man ſo firmly chain'd to the top of a high Spire, as to have the <hi>Greateſt Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of his Faſtneſs, yet looking down, could not but fear a Fall.</p>
               <p>We may then eaſily perceive, that from the making Faith to lie in a <hi>perſwaſion of the pardon of ſin,</hi> it cannot be juſtly inferred, that whoever doubts of God's Mercy in Chriſt, is deſtitute of Juſtifying Faith: for this perſwaſion may be in the <hi>Habit,</hi> where not in the <hi>Act,</hi> and is conſiſtent enough with ſtrong fears, and many doubts, as the firſt Reformers expreſly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which is enough to free them from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of driving by their Doctrine every ſound Believer who hath any doubts about his being pardoned, into the Horrour of Deſpair.</p>
               <p>Nor did they ſo deſcribe Juſtifying Faith as to give unto any an occaſion to expect Heaven, whilſt they lived under the Reigning Power of their ſins. On the contrary they held,</p>
               <p>III. That <hi>none, <hi>who continue to live under the Reigning Power of their Luſts had,</hi>
                  </hi> or <hi>whilſt ſo, can have Saving Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas conſtantly aſſerted by them, <q>That to true Juſtifying Faith, whether ſtrong, or weak, <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Perpetuity</hi> were too eſſential, and inſeparable Properties; the firſt is neceſſary, that it may be a <hi>Living</hi> Faith, exciting in the Believer the Life of Chriſt, that is to ſay,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107137:64"/>ſuch a Life as ſtirred up in his heart ſuch <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> motions, thoughts and deſires, conform to God's Law, as drove out all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affections. Thus much, they ſaid, was the Import of thoſe Scriptures, which ſpeak of <hi>purifying the heart, mortifying the fleſh, quickning of the ſpirit, crucifying, and burying the Old Man, putting on the New.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt in the Sacred Scriptures doth ſo very much preſs this one thing, eſpecially in the Epiſtles of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> that it muſt be acknowledged, that this is ſo Eſſential a Property of Faith, that it cannot be true Juſtifying Faith without it, as <hi>all of us unanimouſtly hold.</hi>

               <p>Excellent <hi>Camero</hi> hath deliver'd the ſenſe of them, who make the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> the <hi>only Subject of Faith,</hi> with much clearneſs, aſſuring us, <q>That we muſt abide by this, that <hi>Faith is not a Work.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> (ſaith he) think they preſs us with this Argument; <hi>viz.</hi> ſeeing Faith is a <hi>Work,</hi> the aſſerting that we are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, can import nothing leſs than that we are Juſtified by <hi>ſome Work.</hi> There are others, who profeſs to abhor nothing more than this <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine, who confeſs, That <hi>Faith is a Work,</hi> but then add, that <hi>it</hi> doth not Juſtifie <hi>as a Work.</hi> But the Scriptures do always
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107137:78"/>diſtinguiſh <hi>Faith</hi> from <hi>Works,</hi> yea oppoſe <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>Works</hi> in the matter of our Juſtification. And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, when they ſay we are Juſtified partly by <hi>Faith,</hi> and partly by <hi>Works,</hi> unleſs they will be guilty of a very groſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, muſt diſtinguiſh the one from the other. <hi>Faith</hi> therefore <hi>is not a Work:</hi> that it is called the <hi>Work of God, Joh.</hi> 6.29. is only by way of <hi>Alluſion,</hi> as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.27. calls <hi>Faith a Law.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> continually glorying in their <hi>Works,</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> in their <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> as they were the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Chriſt in anſwer unto them, having attributed <hi>Juſtification</hi> to <hi>Faith,</hi> uſeth their own words, who expecting to <hi>be Juſtified by <hi>Works;</hi>
                     </hi> Chriſt doth as it were thus ſpeak unto them: Will ye have Life by your <hi>Works?</hi> then <hi>work this Work, <hi>Believe in the Son of God.</hi>
                     </hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there is this difference between <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Works: Faith</hi> gives nothing to God; it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receives: <hi>Works</hi> are an <hi>Euchariſtical Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> which we offer unto God. <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> it is as the <hi>Hand</hi> of the Soul by which we receive ſaving Benefits from God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Laying this Foundation, we go on, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. That <hi>Juſtification is by <hi>Faith,</hi> not by <hi>Works.</hi>
                     </hi> 1. The Apoſtle, when he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly diſpute of Juſtification, he never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the <hi>Works of Holineſs,</hi> or <hi>Sanctification</hi> unto <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> which undoubtedly he would have done, if he had thought that any thing in our Juſtification muſt be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Works.</hi> His Adverſaries making it their buſineſs to expoſe him, as one, who, by by his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> lets looſe the Reins to all
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107137:78"/>manner of <hi>Licenſciouſneſs,</hi> if he had thought that Juſtification had been by any <hi>Works,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, could eaſily have anſwered them by ſaying, He <hi>denyed not Juſtification by Works,</hi> but earneſtly contended for its being by the <hi>Works of Sanctification.</hi>
                  </q> But that he never did for healways oppoſed <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>Good Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <q>All our Salvation conſiſts in the Free-Pardon of Sin, which God in the Goſpel doth offer unto men, not ſingly, but ſo as thereby to invite them to <hi>Repentance:</hi> If there had been no place for the Remiſſion of Sin, a Sinner could never entertain a thought about <hi>Repentance;</hi> and in this reſpect would be in the ſame caſe with the <hi>Devils,</hi> who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not, becauſe without the leaſt hope of Pardon. God, therefore to take away all <hi>Diſpair</hi> from men, offers them the <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sin,</hi> that is to ſay, in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. For no <hi>Remiſſion without a Sacrifice,</hi> and no <hi>Expiatory Attoning</hi> Sacrifice, beſides that of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now what Faculty of the Soul is <hi>that</hi> by which the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of Sin is <hi>Perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> None ſurely but <hi>Faith.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>Believeth</hi> God, who maketh the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Hope</hi> is that, which <hi>expests</hi> the <hi>thing</hi> Promiſed: But <hi>Charity,</hi> beholding the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of him who Promiſes, in the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Promiſe <hi>Loves</hi> him. Whrefore ſeeing 'tis <hi>Faith</hi> only, which acquieſces in the <hi>Free Promiſe</hi> of God through Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>apprehends the Forgiveneſs of Sin;</hi> Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is by the Holy Ghoſt aſcrib'd only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Faith. However by the way it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, That no one doth certainly and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107137:79"/>believe the Promiſe made unto him, but he <hi>immediately Repents of his Sin.</hi> For on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all occaſion of Diſpair is taken out of the way, and ſuch is the Excellency, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Glory of the Promiſe, as to take off the Heart from the Love of the World; whence it may be truly ſaid, that we are Juſtifyed by Faith alone, and that we are Sanctifyed by Faith alone, for 'tis <hi>Faith that purifyeth the Heart,</hi> Act. 13.9.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <q>The reaſon why God forgives the Sins of the Penitent is this, namely <hi>Becauſe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is made to Gods Juſtice by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who has purchaſed this Grace for us: But the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of Chriſt cannot be <hi>apprehended</hi> by us any other way but by Faith: Juſtification therefore muſt be aſcribed only unto Faith.

               <p>There are other Arguments, which he urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this very purpoſe. But from what he hath here delivered, It's plain, that <hi>Faith,</hi> not <hi>being an Act of the <hi>Will,</hi>
                  </hi> is <hi>not a Work;</hi> but is diſtinguiſhed from it, and oppoſed unto it, and that therefore when it is ſaid, we <hi>are Juſtified by Faith;</hi> it cannot be that we are <hi>Juſtified by a work.</hi> That Chriſts ſatisfaction hath <hi>purchaſed Pardon;</hi> which can be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by us no otherwiſe than <hi>by Faith;</hi> that Faith is the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> or as the hand of the Soul by which we receive forgiveneſs. That tho from this Faith, <hi>Hope, Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedience immediately ſlow,</hi> and are <hi>inſeparable;</hi> yet they are no cauſe at all of our Juſtification; which is enough to make it manifeſt that one, who is far from <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> may deny
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107137:79"/>Faiths being an <hi>Act of the Will,</hi> and confine it wholly to the Underſtanding. For <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> may be diſtinct Graces, though whilſt in this Life inſeparable: and ſo long as <hi>Hope, Love,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel Obodience</hi> are held to be <hi>inſeparable</hi> from Faith there is, there can be no danger in placing Faith only in the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> But many Advantages againſt the <hi>Papiſt, Arminian,</hi> and <hi>Socinian,</hi> to the Exaltation of the Glory of <hi>Free Grace</hi> are hereby obtained.</p>
